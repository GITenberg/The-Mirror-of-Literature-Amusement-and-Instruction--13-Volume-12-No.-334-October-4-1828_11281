<h2>
    UNITED SERVICE CLUB-HOUSE
</h2>
<p>
    Modern club-houses are, for the most part, splendid specimens of the
    style which luxury and good-living have attained in this country.
    Such are their internal recommendations; but to the public they are
    interesting for the architectural embellishment which they add to the
    streets of the metropolis. If we reason on Bishop Berkeley's theory&mdash;that
    all the mansions, equipages, &amp;c. we see abroad, are intended for our
    gratification&mdash;we must soon forget the turtle, venison, and claret
    that are stored in the larders and cellars of club-houses, whilst
    our admiration is awakened at the taste which is lavished on their
    exteriors.
</p>
<p>
    The "United Service" Club-House is, as its name implies, intended for
    the Officers of the Army and Navy, who, in these pacific times, may here
    enjoy <i>otium cum dignitate</i>, and fill up the intervals of refection, in
    reading the "history of the war," from the noble quarto to the last
    dispatches received at the Foreign Office.
</p>
<p>
    The above Club-House, which occupies an angle of Charles-street and
    Regent-street, is, however, but a meagre specimen of the abilities of
    the architect, Mr. Smirke. It has none of the characteristic decorations
    of either service, if we except the bas-relief on the entrance-front in
    Charles street, which represents Britannia distributing laurels to her
    brave sons by land and sea. The architecture of the whole is cold and
    unfeeling, and even the columns supporting the porticoes are of a very
    rigid order&mdash;when we consider that the clubhouse is not an official
    establishment, but one intended for luxurious accommodation, and that it
    would have admitted of much more florid embellishment. At the same time,
    although we quarrel with the frigidity of the exterior, we do not
    question the warmth of its kitchens, or the potency of its cellars;
    neither do we affect any knowledge of the latter&mdash;nay, not even enough
    to weave into a "fashionable" novel.
</p>
<p>
    A new mansion is building for the United Service Club, on the site of
    Carlton House, under the superintendance of Mr. Nash, and which, with
    another new clubhouse for the Athaenaeum, will form an entrance to the
    new square opposite Waterloo-Place. The taste of the sword and pen does
    not, however, agree, and their buildings are dissimilar. In the United
    Service Club are two rooms of 150 feet by 50, the floors of which are
    constructed of cast-iron girders. At the back of these club-houses will
    be a large ornamental garden.

<h3>
    FUNERAL GARLANDS.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</h4>
<p>
    The primitive Christians censured a practice prevalent among the Romans,
    of decorating a corpse, previous to interment or combustion, with
    garlands and flowers. Their reprehension extended also to a periodical
    custom of placing the "first-fruits of Flora" on their graves and tombs.
    Thus Anchises, in Dryden's Virgil,<i>Aeneid,</i> book 6, says,
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Full canisters of fragrant lilies bring,</p>
<p>  Mix'd with the purple roses of the spring;</p>
<p>  Let me with <i>funeral flowers</i> his body strew&mdash;</p>
<p>  This gift, which parents to their children owe,</p>
<p>  This unavailing gift I may bestow."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    Notwithstanding the anathemas of the church, these simple, interesting,
    and harmless (if not laudable) practices still remain. The early customs
    and features of all nations approximate; and whether the following
    traits, which a friend has kindly obliged me with, are relics of Roman
    introduction, or national, I leave the antiquary to decide.
</p>
<p>
    On Palm Sunday, in several villages in South Wales, a custom prevails
    of cleaning the grave-stones of departed friends and acquaintances, and
    ornamenting them with flowers, &amp;c. On the Saturday preceding, a troop of
    servant girls go to the churchyard with pails and brushes, to renovate
    the various mementos of affection, clean the letters, and take away
    the weeds. The next morning their young mistresses attend, with the
    gracefulness of innocence in their countenances, and the roses of health
    and beauty blooming on their cheeks. According to their fancy, and
    according to the state of the season, they place on the stones
    snow-drops, crocuses, lilies of the valley, and roses.
</p>
<p>
    A sacrifice such as this, so pure, so innocent, so expressive, is surely
    acceptable to the great God of nature.
</p>
<h4>
    QUAESITOR.
</h4>
<p>
    To our Correspondent's communication, which is worthy of record, from
    its originality, we could add many well-authenticated accounts of the
    rite of decorating graves, &amp;c. There is in our drawer an interesting
    paper on the subject; but we give <i>Quaesitor</i> the priority.

<h3>
    THE SPIDER'S WEB.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror</i>.)
</h4>
<p>
    To the curious among the perusers of the Mirror, it may not be
    uninteresting to know that a beautiful impression may be taken on paper
    of the reticulated web of the <i>field-spider</i>, by sprinkling it finely
    with any dark-coloured liquid, and placing the paper intended for the
    impression behind the web, and drawing it gently towards
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page211" name="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span>
 you. I do not
    know of what ingredients bookbinders' blue-sprinkle is made, but it seems
    to absorb the gelatinous matter of which the web is composed. The idea
    that an impression might be produced in this manner, was suggested to me
    by observing the dew on the web in the morning.
</p>
<h4>
    <i>Rugby</i>. W.I.T.
</h4>
<p>
    Our ingenious Correspondent has, on the fly-leaf of his letter, furnished
    us with the impression of a web, as a proof of the practicability of the
    above.

<h3>
    ATAR GUL.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</h4>
<p>
    Who hath not inhaled with ecstasy the delicious, the heavenly odour of
    "the Atar Gul, more precious than gold?" Who hath not in fancy wandered,
    as he inspired it, to the terrestrial paradise from whence it is
    procured? And who that knew not how so volatile an essence was collected,
    hath not marvelled, over the enjoyment of Otto of Roses? Persia, Turkey,
    and Egypt, are the principal countries in which it is manufactured, and
    the Atar of Persia is generally allowed to be the most superior, and the
    most difficult to be obtained genuine. The rose of Cashmire is proverbial
    throughout the east for its brilliancy and fragrance; and "the Roses of
    the Jinan Nile, or Garden of the Nile, (attached to the Emperor of
    Morocco's palace) are unequalled; mattresses are made of their leaves for
    the men of rank to recline upon." I transcribe from a published account
    in my possession, the method of obtaining Atar Gul in the <i>east</i> (for
    I have heard that some <i>English</i> chemists have endeavoured to procure
    it from <i>English</i> roses.) merely begging to observe that it exactly
    corresponds with that given to me by a gentleman who had witnessed the
    process in Egypt.
</p>
<p>
    "<i>Otto of Roses</i>.&mdash;The usual method of making it is, to gather the roses
    with their calyces, and put them into a still with nearly double their
    weight of pure spring water; which, when sufficiently distilled, will be
    highly scented with roses; this is then poured into shallow vessels and
    exposed to the nocturnal air. Next morning, the <i>Atar, or essential oil</i>
    of the flowers is found swimming in small congealed particles on the
    surface of the water; it is carefully collected and preserved in small
    glass bottles."<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> A hundred pounds of the flowers scarcely afford in
    India two drachms of essential oil. "Cent livres de petales de Roses,"
    says a French chemist, "N'en fournissent par la distillation que
    <i>quatre</i> drachmes." Tachenius from the same quantity obtained half
    an ounce, and Hoffman a much larger proportion. The trials of other
    chemists have been attended with various results. It is most difficult
    to procure the <i>genuine</i> Otto of Roses, since even in the countries
    where it is made, the distillers are tempted to put sandal wood, scented
    grasses, and other oily plants into the still with the roses, which
    alter their perfume, and debase the value of the Atar; colour is no test
    of genuineness; green, amber, and light red or pink. The hues of the
    <i>real</i> otto, are also those of the adulterated; the presence of the
    sandal wood may be detected by the simple sense of smelling; but in
    order to discover the union of a grosser oil with the <i>essential</i>, drop
    a very little otto on a piece of clean writing paper, and hold it to the
    fire; if the article is <i>genuine</i>, it will evaporate without leaving
    a mark on the paper, so ethereal is the <i>essential oil of roses!</i> if
    otherwise, a grease-spot will declare the imposition. I need scarcely
    expatiate upon the delicate and long-continuing fragrance which this
    luxuriant perfume imparts to all things with which it comes in contact;
    it is peculiarly calculated for the drawer, writing-desk, &amp;c. since its
    aroma is totally unmingled with that most disagreeable effluvium, which
    is ever proceeding from alcohol. Lavender-water, <i>esprit</i> de rose &amp;c.
    &amp;c. are quite disgusting shut up in box or drawer, but the Atar Gul, is
    as delightful there as in the most open and airy space. Some persons
    there are, however, who have an antipathy to it, and others will, as
    they inhale its delicious odour, fancy with myself, what may be.

<h3>
    SHOOTING AT THE POPINJAY.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</h4>
<p>
    The Popinjay or Popingo (signifying painted bird) is a very favourite and
    popular diversion in Denmark, and of which it may be interesting to give
    some account. A society is constituted of various members, called the
    "King's Shooting Club," who have a code of laws and regulations drawn up
    for their observance; and are under the direction of nine managers. The
    entrance-money is 60 dollars. Members are admitted by ballot, and on
    election receive a diploma on parchment, with the seal of the society.
</p>
<p>
    The meetings are held in a large building in the environs, and members
    are decorated with an order or badge of distinction, which is the figure
    of a gilded bird with outstretched wings, perching on a branch of laurel.
    This is worn on the left breast, and attached to a button-hole of the
    waistcoat by a green silk riband. On the breast are marked the letters
    "<i>D.C.</i>" meaning "<i>Danish Company</i>." On one side of the branch is the
    date 1542, and on the other 1739.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> In the month of August, when the
    amusement commences, the members meet in their hall, and proceed in
    formal procession to an adjoining field on the western side of the city;
    where arrangements are previously made for the numerous spectators. The
    bird to be shot at is about the size of a parrot, gilded, and placed on
    the top of a high pole. On their way to the field they are attended by a
    band of music, which precedes the members as they march with their pieces
    over their shoulders.
</p>
<p>
    According to a law of the institution, the competitors fire at this mark
    with large rifle pieces charged with balls, and rested on triangular
    stands. Whoever is so fortunate as to strike the wing of the Popingo
    first, is entitled to a prize. This is sometimes a pair of handsome
    candlesticks, or a silver tea-pot and spoons. Whoever hits the tail is
    entitled to another prize not inferior to the last; but he who wounds the
    body of the bird is complimented with the principal one which weighs at
    least 65 ounces of silver, and is honoured with the title of the "BIRD
    KING." These prizes are surmounted with the royal cipher and crown. His
    Danish majesty opens this ceremony in person, and is entitled to the
    first shot, and the queen to the second, then they are followed by the
    other branches of the royal family in succession. The firing continues
    until the bird falls. In returning to the hall, the "Bird King,"
    accompanied by the procession, first enters the room, and is placed at
    the head of the table laid out for an entertainment, even in the presence
    of his majesty. On this occasion he is understood to be invested with
    peculiar privileges, such as proposing toasts, directing the order of the
    feast, &amp;c. and his own health is first given by the judges. The members
    pay 100 dollars each. The festival is honoured by the presence of the
    royal family, and no person excepting the members, the foreign ministers,
    and other distinguished persons, who are specially invited, can be
    admitted.
</p>
<p>
    The practice of shooting at the Popingo or Popinjay, however, is not
    peculiar to Denmark. In Scotland a nearly similar amusement is observed,
    where the head marksman receives the title of "Captain." In a future
    paper, perhaps, I may notice the subject again, as it may prove
    interesting.

<h3>
    IMMENSE TROUT.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>To the Editor of the Mirror.</i>)
</h4>
<p>
    In No. 331 of the MIRROR, I observed an article on Trout-fishing in
    Westmoreland. The writer states, that the largest trout ever caught in
    that county weighed four pounds and a half. This circumstance
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page213" name="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span>
 induces me
    to send you the annexed account respecting trout in Kent.
</p>
<p>
    The county of Kent affords a vast number of trout-streams, which are
    nowhere surpassed in England; and fish of extraordinary size and beauty
    have frequently been caught in them. Some years ago, at Farningham, (a
    village through which a noble trout-stream takes its course), stood a
    flour-mill, the proprietor of which informed my father, that he had often
    observed an enormous trout in the stream, near the mill-head, and that he
    would endeavour to catch it, in order to ascertain its real dimensions,
    as he was very desirous to have a picture done from it. My father having
    consented to undertake the picture, the proprietor caused the trout,
    though with much difficulty, to be caught in a stub-net. It appeared of a
    most beautiful colour, and was finely variegated with spots; but it
    possessed such exceeding strength, that the assistance of two men was
    necessary to hold it down on a table while the measurement was made. It
    proved to be twenty-six inches in length, and weighed <i>nine pounds</i>. The
    proprietor returned it to the water unhurt, for he would by no means
    suffer it to be killed, but caused food from time to time to be thrown
    into the stream. This food chiefly consisted of meal and flour, made into
    small balls, which allured the trout to remain near the mill-head. When
    the particulars concerning this remarkable fish were circulated, many
    persons came from different parts of Kent, and even from London, to
    obtain a sight of it.
</p>
<p>
    Numerous individuals now living at Farningham can attest the truth of
    this account; and, probably, the painting may still be seen at that place.

    NATIONAL VARIETIES.
</h3>
<p>
    (<i>Continued from page</i> 165.)
</p>
<p>
    It is almost impossible to lay down any rule which would define the
    variations of national manners as having any reference to climate. We
    frequently find that the passage of a river, or a chain of mountains,
    dividing countries of the same natural features, brings us among an
    entirely new people, and presents us with a fresh scene in the melodrama
    of life. The inhabitants of Languedoc and Gascony, and the southern parts
    of France, are the gayest and most lively of the subjects of Charles X.;
    but the moment we have crossed the Pyrenees, we are among one of the
    gravest nations in the world, the Spaniards. Again, contrast the
    solemnity and deep sense of honour of the Turks, with the vivacity and,
    we regret to add, the deceit and bad faith of the unfortunate modern
    Greeks. The virtuous spirit will, we trust, revive in the Morea with the
    return of civilization and freedom; for, as no one will attribute the
    degradation of the modern Greeks from the high moral cultivation of their
    ancestors, to any alteration in the climate of their country, so let us
    never despair of the return of virtue, of poetry, of the arts and
    sciences, whilst Parnassus and Helicon still enjoy the same glorious sun,
    and whilst the Isles are still gilded by eternal summer. We want no
    proofs that patriotism still lives in Greece, and with that feeling will
    ever be associated the powers that are able to invigorate a nation.

    Although a mountainous country like Greece, situated in the loveliest
    climate in the world, must of course have some effect on the spirit of
    the people, yet the degree of it seems extremely uncertain. The Swiss
    seem in a great measure to have lost their renown for patriotism, by
    their slavish submissions to foreign yokes during the late war, and by
    the apathy with which they allow their rights to be trampled on at this
    day by a tyrannical aristocracy at home. There is now a proverb of
    "<i>Point d'argent, point de Suisse!</i>"&mdash;a melancholy reflection for a land
    where Tell drew his unerring shaft in the cause of freedom&mdash;where, so
    late as 1798, a patriot of the canton of Schwyz concluded an address with
    these words:&mdash;"The dew of the mountain may still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page214" name="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span>
 moisten its verdure&mdash;the
    sweets of the valley may still shed their fragrance around you&mdash;the
    purple grape may still mingle with the green vine&mdash;the note of the maiden
    may still sound sweetly to the ear of her lover&mdash;the soft cry of the
    infant charm the feelings of the father&mdash;the confiding wife may yet
    gladden the home of her husband&mdash;but the heart of man will be rotten&mdash;the
    spirit of your ancestors extinguished&mdash;Switzerland no more, if you submit
    to the French. If you love your country, and value your honour, be men,
    and resist. If not, prove cowards, and obey."
</p>
<p>
    Patriotism, however, does not confine itself to mountains, as witness the
    history of the ancient and modern republics of Italy; of the resistance
    of Holland and Belgium to their oppressors; of the English and French
    revolutions. It is unnecessary to look across the Atlantic, to prove the
    existence of the pure plant in its most healthy and vigorous growth. The
    new world is dedicated to the cause of liberty, and from that good seed
    is now springing forth fruit an hundred fold; the progress of
    civilization, of knowledge, of virtue, and happiness in the United States,
    is, by every recent traveller there, proved to be immense. The example of
    her own children is becoming an additional security for right principles
    to the mother country; and long may it so continue:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  Yes! in that generous cause, for ever strong,</p>
<p>  The patriot's virtue and the poet's song,</p>
<p>  Still as the tide of ages rolls away,</p>
<p>  Shall charm the world, unconscious of decay!</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    We cannot even contend that the sun has the effect of inflaming the
    imaginations of men, and infusing into them either vivacity or a poetic
    spirit. The French, Greeks, Egyptians, and Persians are all remarkable
    for gaiety; while the Spaniards, Turks, and Chinese, the latitudes of
    whose countries vary but little, are noted for a grave and serious
    deportment. The land that has given birth to Shakspeare and Milton has no
    reason to complain of the want of warmth of imagination. Klopstock and
    Goëthe,&mdash;the latter now allowed to be first of the living poets,&mdash;are
    instances of the wide range of the spirit of poetry. Shall we, who have
    seen Byron writing, as it were, in the midst of us, yield assent to
    calling Greece and Italy the countries of imagination, <i>par excellence</i>,
    because they have produced Homer and Dante? Assuredly not. We cannot even
    admit, as a general proposition, that the languages of the south are
    always the smoothest and most melodious, and the northern ones harsh, and
    not adapted for music. The liquid, smooth, and effeminate language of
    modern Italy is totally different from the strong, energetic, and harsh
    Latin used by the ancient Romans. The Arabic will be immediately admitted,
    by any who has heard a page of it read, to be extremely uncouth and
    disagreeable. The Russian, on the contrary, is soft and musical. And to
    recur to a more familiar instance, we shall find the Welsh tongue, on
    examination, to be in fact very poetic, and peculiarly capable of giving
    force and expression&mdash;whether of grandeur, of terror, or of melody&mdash;to
    the idea the words are intended to convey. Let the reader who understands
    the Welsh pronunciation, judge whether the following distich is not an
    echo to, and as it were a picture of, the sense of the majestic sound of
    thunder:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Tân a dwr y'n ymwriaw,</p>
<p>  Yw'r taranau dreigiau draw."</p>
</div><div class="stanza">
<p>  The roaring thunder, dreadful in its ire,</p>
<p>  Is water warring with aërial fire.</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    The next specimen will show the capability of the Welsh to express soft
    and melodious sounds:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>    "Mae mil o leisian meluson,</p>
<p>    Mai mêl o hyd ym mola hon."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    The mellifluence of these lines, written on a harp, is totally lost in
    the translation:&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  Within the concave of its womb is found</p>
<p>  The magic scale of soul-enchanting sound.</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    The best illustration of the comparative degree of mental excellence
    between the southern and northern nations, is, perhaps, that of Bishop
    Berkeley, who compares the southern wits to cucumbers, which are commonly
    all good of their kind, but at best an insipid fruit; while the northern
    geniuses are like melons, of which not one in fifty is good; but when it
    is so, it has an excellent relish. Now it is not probable that the same
    climate which is favourable to the study of the sciences and to the
    reasoning powers, would prevent their being pushed to the utmost extent;
    and the solution of this difference may, perhaps, depend on the question,
    whether a general diffusion of learning among a people is a state of
    things usually accompanied by a remarkable perfection in particular
    persons. A man of ordinary acquirements in the present day might have
    passed for a prodigy in the thirteenth century; and the novelty and
    distinction attaching to one who rises above the rest, is, of course,
    more difficult to attain in an age where knowledge is possessed
    universally. Inasmuch, therefore, as the liberal arts have been imported
    to us from the south, and their progress is as yet not so extensive in
    cold countries, the stimulus to their cultivation in the latter is so
    much the greater; which
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page215" name="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span>
 is one way of accounting for the giants in
    science that have appeared in the north, It is moreover remarkable, that
    the northern nations have a stronger apprehension of abstract
    propositions, and a greater fondness for generalizing, than seems to be
    the case in the south. The difference between a Frenchman and a German is
    observable in this particular, by any one who attends to their manner of
    telling stories. The former, in giving you an account of his being robbed
    by a servant to whom he had been particularly kind, first tells you the
    facts, and concludes with a reflection, "<i>Voila que le monde est ingrât!</i>"
    The German, on the other hand, in order to prove to you the general
    proposition of the unthankfulness of men to their benefactors, gives you
    the instance that has recently happened. To the one, the fact is
    interesting, because it proves the proposition; to the other, the
    proposition is a conclusion, which he hastily draws from an individual
    occurrence that has suggested it.
</p>
<p>
    The climate does not appear to affect even the bodies of men to any
    great degree. We cannot pronounce that it is the sun which makes
    the African black, when we see the same heat pouring down on the
    copper-coloured American, in the same degree of latitude, though in
    another longitude. The inhabitants of Terra del Fuego are of a very dark
    hue, approaching to black; and yet that island experiences as severe
    cold as any part of the earth, as Sir Joseph Banks and Dr. Solander
    have testified. The complexion and appearance of the Jews, and other
    emigratory races, is the same in all parts of the world. And a stronger
    proof cannot be given, than the marked distinction which still exists
    among the three great families that divide Europe. These three have been
    for the last 2,500 years, and still are, the Celts, the Teutonic race,
    and the Slavonic race.
</p>
<p>
    The Celts have black hair and eyes, and a white skin, verging to brown.
    They chiefly inhabit the west of Europe, viz. the south of France,
    (called by M. Dupin, <i>France obscure</i>,) Spain, Portugal, and the
    greatest part of Italy. To them also belong the ancient Britons, the
    Welsh, Bretons, Irish, Highland Scotch, and the Manks, or people of the
    Isle of Man. The great German race, with blue eyes, yellow or reddish
    hair, and a fair and red skin, occupies the middle of Europe. It
    includes the Swedes, Norwegians, Icelanders, Danes, ancient and modern
    Germans, Saxons and English, Caledonians and Lowland Scotch, the
    Belgians, the Vandals, and the Goths.
</p>
<p>
    The east of Europe contains the Sarmatian and Slavonic tribes, with
    dark hair and eyes, darker skin than the Germans, and larger limbs than
    the Celts. This race includes the Russians, Poles, Croats, Slavons,
    Bohemians, Bulgarians, Cossacks, and other tribes using the Slavonic
    language.
</p>
<p>
    We trust we shall not give offence to such of our readers as wear the
    Celtic appearance, if we assume, as undisputed, the general superiority
    of the Teutonic to the Celtic or Slavonic races in mental acquirements.
    We believe that the German race are pre-eminent for their sense of order,
    of law, and of social institutions; and whether they derive these
    advantages from the east, whence their origin has now been satisfactorily
    traced, or however they have attained them, we have only to reflect on
    the civilization introduced by the Saxons into England&mdash;on the actual
    state of the ancient Britons at present inhabiting Wales and the
    Highlands&mdash;and on the terrible disorder and barbarism that reigns in
    Ireland&mdash;to be thankful that the pure Celtic blood has not been allowed
    to remain unmixed in these islands.
</p>
<p>
    What, then, it will be asked, is the result of these speculations? Are we
    to conclude that the races of men are essentially different, or that the
    variations are attributable to the various degrees of moral cultivation
    that each nation has received? And our answer is, that we are inclined to
    believe the capacities for improvement of races, as of individuals, to
    have been differently bestowed by nature; but that none are actually
    incapable of culture. There is no land, however sterile, that the art of
    man may not make to produce fruit; but the difficulty and expense of
    tillage must be in proportion to the intrinsic richness or poverty of the
    soil. We fear that the soil of the Negroes<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>, of the American Indians,
    and of the Esquimaux, must be laboured at early and late, before it
    brings forth even an average crop. But we do not despair even here. Still
    less could we for a moment depreciate the labours of those who are
    carrying education to the utmost bounds of the earth. The more degraded
    and stupid the condition of any set of people may be, the more
    meritorious and thankworthy are those efforts that are made to advance
    them one point nearer to the heavens&mdash;one step above the beasts that
    perish. The advancement of Hayti, though much overrated, is nevertheless
    considerable; and we trust that national independence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page216" name="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span>
 will co-operate
    there also with the progress of learning, for the increase of happiness
    and prosperity. A free government, high public spirit, and an eager
    desire for wisdom, are permanent securities for the welfare of the state,
    and the happiness of the citizens; and though we cannot control nature,
    let us endeavour by art to supply what is wanting, where her bounty has
    been limited; "let us," in the words of Lord Bacon, "labour to restore
    and enlarge the power and dominion of the whole race of man over the
    universe of things!"

    MORTON BRIDGE.
</h3>
<h3>
    A BALLAD.
</h3>
<h4>
    (<i>For the Mirror</i>.)
</h4>
<p>
    The remorseless tragedy on which this ballad is founded, took place
    upwards of a century ago. In the retired village of Romanby, near
    Northallerton, Yorkshire, there resided a desperate band of coiners,
    whose respectability and cunning concealment precluded all possibility of
    suspicion as to their proceedings. The victim of their revenge was Mary
    Ward, the servant of one of those ruffians. Having obtained an accidental
    view of some secret apartments appropriated to their treasonable
    practices, she unguardedly communicated her knowledge to an acquaintance;
    which reaching her master's ears, he determined to destroy her. The most
    plausible story, time, and means were selected for this purpose. On a
    Sunday evening, after sunset, an unknown personage on horseback arrived
    at her master's mansion, half equipped, to give colour to his alleged
    haste, and slated that he was dispatched for Mary, as <i>her mother was
    dying</i>. She lingered to ask her master's permission; but he feigned sleep,
    and she departed without his leave. On the table of her room was her
    Bible, opened at those remarkable words in Job, "They shall seek me <i>in
    the morning</i>, and shall not find me; and where I am, they shall not come."
    Her home was at the distance of eight miles from Romanby; and Morton
    bridge, hard by the heath where she was murdered, is the traditionary
    scene of her nocturnal revisitings. The author has seen the tree said to
    have been distorted by her in endeavouring to climb the fence; and has
    visited the village and bridge, from which his descriptions are
    accurately taken. The impression of her re-appearance is only
    <i>poetically</i> assumed, for there is too much of what Coleridge would term
    "the divinity of nature" around Morton Bridge, to warrant its association
    with supernatural mysteries.

<h2>
    SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY.
</h2>
<center>
    <i>Tanning</i>.
</center>
<p>
    The tanner steeps the skin at first in a weak infusion of bark, until it
    has acquired a nutmeg brown colour, and then he gradually increases the
    strength of the steeping liquors, and after a time he draws the skin
    out, and finds that it is converted into leather. A thick piece of hide
    requires ten, twelve, or fourteen months, to be converted into good
    leather; and when you consider the length of time consumed in the
    process, and the great capital necessarily employed, you cannot feel
    surprised that various plans should have been proposed to lessen both.
    It was proposed to tan with warm instead of cold liquors; and although
    the tan appeared to promote the skins in a shorter time, the quality of
    the leather was so much injured, that it was soon given up. Then it was
    tried to force the tan through the pores of the skin, by employing great
    pressure; but this was not found to answer. But you may ask why the
    tanner does not put the skins at once into a strong liquor? The reason
    is, that the exterior surface of the skin would soon become tanned, and
    the central part would remain untanned, which, in a short time, would
    begin to rot and decay, and the leather so treated would soon fall to
    pieces. The tanner, therefore, judges of the perfection of the tanning
    by cutting through the leather; and if he finds it of an uniform brown
    colour, without any white streak in the centre, he considers that the
    process has been successfully conducted. It would
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page218" name="page218"></a>[pg 218]</span>
 require much time to
    describe all the operations of the <i>tan-yard</i>, but many of them are
    interesting, as regards the chemical agents employed. I might have
    mentioned to you, that the mode of preparing the skin for tanning, is
    first to soak it in lime-water, by which the hair is easily detached;
    but the cuticle and under part of the skin, the cellular substance, are
    scraped off after it has been soaked in the lime water. A great variety
    of substances have been used for tanning, as the acorn-cup of the
    oriental bark; catechu and sumach have been also used; but the oak bark
    is most generally used, as furnishing a large quantity of astringent
    matter. It is not the business of the chemist to describe the different
    kinds of leather, but I may just mention, that the upper leather of
    shoes is called <i>curried</i> leather; the leather having been tanned, is
    rubbed over with oil before it is dried, and it is then very flexible,
    pliable, and durable; but if you take a piece of dry leather, and try to
    rub it over with oil or grease, you cannot make it enter the pores of
    the leather; the black colour is produced by rubbing it over with a
    solution of green vitriol, the sulphate of iron. <i>Russian</i> leather is
    tanned in an infusion of birch bark, and is said to be afterwards mixed
    with a quantity of birch tar, to give it that odour for which it is
    peculiar, which renders it valuable for book-binding, on account of
    preventing it from being attacked by insects. <i>Tawed</i> leather, used for
    gloves, is made by impregnating the skin with a liquor containing alum
    and salt, and afterwards washed in a mixture of yolks of eggs and water;
    the saline and animal matters combine, and give it that peculiar
    softness, and such leather is afterwards coloured as may be required;
    having been rolled over wooden rollers, in which are grooves, it is
    called <i>Morocco</i> leather. These are the principal varieties of leather
    employed in this country.&mdash;<i>Brande's Lectures&mdash;Lancet</i>.

    thunder-rods.

    <i>Fly in Wheat</i>.
</center>
<p>
    In North America, much damage is done to crops of wheat by the Hessian
    fly. The female deposits from one to eight or more eggs upon a single
    plant of wheat, between the vagina or sheath of the inner leaf and the
    culm nearest the roots; in which situation, with its head towards the
    root or first joint, the young larva pass the winter. They eat the stem,
    which thus becomes weak, and breaks; but are checked by another insect,
    called the destructor, otherwise whole crops of wheat would be
    annihilated.

    floating islands of the Lago de Bassanello, near Rome; in Loch Lomond, in
    Scotland, there is or was a floating island; and in the Lake of

    Water, in Cumberland, such islands appear and disappear at indefinite
    periods. Mr. A. Pettingal, jun. has recently described a floating island,
    about a mile southwards of Newbury port, 140 poles in length, and 120 in
    breadth. It is covered with trees; and in summer, when dry weather is

    gale of wind threw it high above the reach of ordinary tides; in which
    situation it took nine months to rot; during which process travellers
    were obliged to change the direction of the road for nearly a quarter of
    a mile, to avoid the offensive effluvia. It rotted so completely, that

<p>
    The head of a Hippopotamus has recently been brought to England, with
    all the flesh about it, in a high state of preservation. This amphibious
    animal was harpooned while in combat with a crocodile, in a lake in
    the interior of Africa. The head measures near four feet long, and
    eight feet in circumference; the jaws open two feet wide, and the
    cutting-teeth of which it has four in each jaw, are above a foot
    long, and four inches in circumference. Its ears are not bigger than
    a terrier's, and are much about the same shape. This formidable and
    terrific creature, when full-grown, measures about 17 feet long from the
    extremity of the snout to the insertion of the tail, above 16 feet in
    circumference round the body, and stands above 7 feet high. It runs with
    astonishing swiftness for its great bulk, at the bottom of lakes and
    rivers, but not with as much ease on land. When excited, it puts forth
    its full strength, which is prodigious. "I have seen," says a mariner,
    as we find it in Dampier, "one of these animals open its jaws, and
    seizing a boat between its teeth, at once bite and sink it to the
    bottom. I have seen it on another occasion place itself under one of our
    boats, and rising under it, overset it, with six men who were in it, but
    who, however, happily received no other injury." At one time it was not
    uncommon in the Nile, but now it is no where to be found in that river,
    except above the cataracts.

    We are friends to the exposition of the weak sides of great men, inasmuch

    stumbling-blocks along every road of petty ambition. It would, however,
    be but a sorry toil for the most cynical critic to illustrate these
    vagaries otherwise than so many slips and trippings of the tongue and pen,
    to which all men are liable in their unguarded moments&mdash;from Homer to
    Anacreon Moore, or Demosthenes to Mr. Brougham. Our course is rather that

    Aeneas in Virgil, that the then habit of spirits was beyond the force of

    There may be, also, a sort of anachronism of the limbs, as in the case of
    the painter of Toledo, who painted the story of the three wise men of the
    east coming to worship, and bringing their presents to our Lord, upon his
    birth, at Bethlehem, whence he presents them as three Arabian, or Indian
    kings; two of them are white, and one of them black; but, unhappily, when
    he drew the latter part of them kneeling, which, to be sure, was done
    after their faces, their legs being necessarily a little intermixed, he
    made three black feet for the negro king, and but three white feet for
    the two white kings; and yet never discovered the mistake till the piece
    was presented to the king, and hung up in the great church.

    ancient papyrus, but on paper made of rags. On some occasion, a visiter,
    to whom this was shown, observed, with affected solemnity, that the

<h3>
    VIRGINIA WATER,
</h3>
<center>
    (<i>The favourite Retreat of his Majesty</i>.)
</center>
<p>
    Virginia Water was planted, and the lake executed, under the direction of
    Paul Sandby, at a time when this part of Windsor Forest was the favourite
    residence of Duke William of Cumberland. The artificial water is the
    largest in the kingdom, with the single exception of Blenheim; the
    cascade is, perhaps, the most striking imitation we have of the great
    works of nature; and the grounds are arranged in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page221" name="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span>
 the grandest style of
    landscape-gardening. The neighbouring scenery is bold and rugged, being
    the commencement of Bagshot Heath; and the variety of surface agreeably
    relieves the eye, after the monotony of the first twenty miles from town,
    which fatigues the traveller either upon the Bath or Western roads. At
    the time when the public were allowed to visit Virginia Water, the best
    point of entrance was at the gate at Bishopsgate; near which very pretty
    village, or rather green, the Royal Lodge is at present situated. Shelley,
    who had a true eye for the picturesque, resided for some time at this
    place; and it would have been difficult for a poet to have found, in any
    of the highly cultivated counties of England, a spot so full of the most
    exquisite variety of hill and dale, of wood and water,&mdash;so fitted to call
    forth and cherish the feelings upon which poetry must depend for its
    peculiar nurture.
</p>
<p>
    Bishopsgate is situated about a mile to the right of the western road
    from London, after you ascend the hill beyond Egham. To the left, St.
    Anne's Hill, the favoured residence of Charles Fox, is a charming object;
    and upon the ridge which the traveller ascends, is the spot which has
    given a name to Denham's celebrated poem. "Cooper's Hill" is not shut out
    from the contemplative searchers after the beauties of nature; and,
    however the prospect here may be exceeded by scenes of wider extent, or
    more striking grandeur, certainly the <i>locale</i> of the earliest, and
    perhaps the best, descriptive poem of our language, is calculated to
    produce the warmest feelings of admiration, both for its actual beauty
    and its unrivalled associations. From an elevation of several hundred
    feet, you look down upon a narrow fertile valley, through which the
    Thames winds with surpassing loveliness. Who does not recollect the
    charming lines with which Denham describes the "silver river:"&mdash;
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Oh! could I flow thee, and make thy stream</p>
<p>  My great example, as it is my theme;</p>
<p>  Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;</p>
<p>  Strong without rage; without o'erflowing full."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    Immediately at your feet is the plain of Runnemede, where the great
    battle between John and the Barons was fought; and in the centre of the
    river is the little fishing island, where Magna Charta was signed. At the
    extremity of the valley is Windsor Castle, rising up in all the pomp of
    its massive towers. We recollect the scene as Windsor <i>was</i>. Whatever Mr.
    Wyattville may have done for its internal improvement, and for its
    adaptation to the purposes of a modern residence without sacrificing all
    its character of antiquity, we fear that he has destroyed its picturesque
    effect in the distant landscape. Its old characteristic feature was that
    of a series of turrets rising above the general elevation. By raising the
    intermediate roofs, without giving a proportionate height to the towers,
    the whole line has become square and unbroken. This was, perhaps, an
    unavoidable fault; but it is a fault.
</p>
<p>
    From Cooper's Hill, the entrance to Virginia Water is a walk of a quarter
    of an hour. We were accustomed to wander down a long and close plantation
    of pines, where the rabbit ran across with scarcely a fear of man. A more
    wild and open country succeeded; and we then followed the path, through
    many a "bosky bourn," till we arrived at a rustic bridge, which crossed
    the lake at a narrow neck, where the little stream was gradually lost
    amongst the underwood. A scene of almost unrivalled beauty here burst
    upon the view. For nearly a mile, a verdant walk led along, amidst the
    choicest evergreens, by the side of a magnificent breadth of water. The
    opposite shore was rich with the heather-bloom; and plantations of the
    most graceful trees&mdash;the larch, the ash, and the weeping birch ("the lady
    of the woods"), broke the line of the wide lake, and carried the
    imagination on, in the belief that some mighty river lay beyond that
    screening wood. The cascade was at length reached. Cascades are much upon
    the same plan, whether natural or artificial; the scale alone makes the
    difference. This cascade is sufficiently large not to look like a
    plaything; and if it were met with in Westmoreland or Wales, tourists
    would dilate much upon its beauties. At this point the water may be
    easily forded; and after a walk of the most delicious seclusion, we used
    to reach a bold arch, over which the public road was carried. Here have
    been erected some of the antique columns, that, a few years ago, were in
    the court-yard of the British Museum.
</p>
<p>
    From this arch a variety of walks, of the most delightful retirement,
    present themselves. They are principally bounded with various trees of
    the pine tribe, intermingled with laurel and acacia. The road gradually
    ascends to a considerable elevation, where there is a handsome building,
    called the Belvidere. The road from this spot is very charming. We
    descend from this height, through a wild path, by the side of trees of
    much more ancient growth than the mass around; and, crossing the high
    road, again reach the lake, at a point where its dimensions are ample and
    magnificent. About this part a splendid
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page222" name="page222"></a>[pg 222]</span>
 fishing-temple has lately been
    erected. Of its taste we can say nothing.
</p>
<p>
    The common road from Blacknest (the name of this district of Windsor
    Forest) to the Royal Lodge is strikingly beautiful. Virginia Water is
    crossed by a very elegant bridge, built by Sandby; on one side of it the
    view terminates in a toy of the last age&mdash;a Chinese temple; on the other
    it ranges over a broad expanse of water. The road sometimes reminds one
    of the wildness of mountain scenery, and at another turn displays all the
    fertility of a peaceful agricultural district. We at length pass the
    secluded domain of the Royal Lodge; and when we reach the edge of the
    hill, we look upon a vista of the most magnificent elms, and over an
    expanse of the most striking forest scenery, with the splendid Castle
    terminating the prospect&mdash;a monument of past glories, which those who
    have a feeling for their country's honour may well uphold and cherish.&mdash;

<h3>
    TEA.
</h3>
<p>
    The principal article of our commerce with China, namely, tea, is,
    perhaps, more singular in its history than any other article of commerce
    in the known world. A simple and unsophisticated shrub, in little more
    than half a century, has become an article of such general consumption,
    that it seems to form one of the prime articles of existence among the
    great bulk of mankind. It is the peculiar growth of a country, of which
    it forms almost the only link of connexion with the rest of the world. It
    forms the source of the largest commercial revenue to the British
    Government of any other commodity whatever, and of the largest commercial
    profits to the individuals concerned in its importation. Withal, it is
    the simplest, the most harmless thing that ever was offered to the
    gratification of man,&mdash;having, it is believed and argued by many, a moral
    influence wherever it is diffused. It is the rallying point of our
    earliest associations; it has ever given an additional charm to our
    firesides; and tends, perhaps, more than any one thing, to confirm the
    pre-existing domestic habits of the British public. Its exhilarating
    qualities are eagerly sought after as a restorative and solace from the
    effects of fatigue or dissipation; the healthy and the sick, the young
    and the old, all equally resort to the use of it, as yielding all the
    salutary influence of strong liquors, without their baneful and
    pernicious effects. Yet this shrub, so simple and so useful, is delivered
    to the community of this country, so surcharged with duties and profits
    beyond its original cost, that, did it contain all the mischievous
    qualities that are opposed to its real virtues, it could not be more
    strictly guarded from general use.
</p>
<p>
    For the whole of our imports, including factory expenses and commission,
    the original cost in China amounts to the sum of two millions sterling.
    This is wonderfully increased before the British public can have any
    access to the article of consumption; thus:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
1. The value of the Company's importations from China
   into Great Britain, as established by their own
   statements, is                                          £2,000,000

2. On this they charge 100 per cent, for their own
   especial benefit                                         2,000,000

3. And the Government duty, as by law established, is
   equal to the original cost, and the profits charged
   by the company; both forming the <i>sale price</i>              4,000,000
                                                           ----------

    DEATH OF YOUNG PARK.
</h3>
<p>
    It is quite inconceivable with what increased zeal new candidates for
    African discovery come forward the moment that the death of any fresh
    victim to this pestilential country is announced. To the list of those
    who have already fallen, may be added young Park, the son of the late
    enterprising Mungo Park, and a midshipman of his majesty's ship Sybille.
    He went out in this ship with a full determination to proceed on foot,
    and alone, from the coast to the spot where his father perished, in the
    hope of hearing some authentic and more detailed account of the
    catastrophe than had yet been received. With leave of the commodore, he
    set out from Accra, and proceeded as far as Yansong, the chief town of
    Acquimbo, distant from the coast about one hundred and forty miles. Here
    the natives were celebrating the Yam feast, a sort of religious ceremony,
    to witness which Park got up into a Fetish tree, which is regarded by the
    natives with fear and dread. Here he remained a great part of the day,
    exposed to the sun, and was observed to drink a great quantity of palm
    wine. In dropping down from one of the lower branches, he fell on the
    ground, and said, that he felt a severe
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page223" name="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span>
 shock in his head. He was that
    evening seized with a fever, and died in three days, on the 31st October,
    1827. As soon as the king, Akitto, heard of his death, he ordered all his
    baggage to be brought to his house, and instantly despatched a messenger
    to Accra, first making him swear "by the head of his father," that he
    would not sleep till he had delivered the message; it was to inform the
    resident of the event, and that all the property of the deceased would be
    forthwith sent down to Accra. This was accordingly done, and it did not
    appear on examination, that a single article was missing; even an old hat,
    without a crown, was not omitted. There was an idle report of Park being
    poisoned, for which there appears not the slightest foundation.&mdash;<i>Q. Rev.</i>

<h3>
    CORPORATION LEARNING.
</h3>
<p>
    At a late meeting of a certain corporation in Dorsetshire, for the
    nomination of a person to fill the office of Mayor, a sufficient number
    of the burgesses not being in attendance, it was intimated that an
    application would be made for a <i>Mandamus</i>, when one of "the worthy
    electors," being un-"learned in the law," innocently remarked, "I hope
    <i>he</i> will come, and then <i>he'll</i> put <i>un</i> all right and make <i>un</i> elect
    one."

    This is not a Joe Miller joke, but one of actual and recent occurrence;
    although there is a similar story fathered on a sapient civic authority.

<h3>
    SELLING A WOMAN.
</h3>
<p>
    The value that was set upon the bond-servants in the West Indies, is
    curiously exemplified in the following anecdote:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
    There was a planter in Barbadoes that came to his neighbour, and said to
    him, "Neighbour, I hear you have lately brought good store of servants
    out of the last ship that came from England; and I hear withal that you
    want provisions. I have great want of a woman servant, and would be glad
    to make an exchange. If you will let me have some of your woman's flesh,
    you shall have some of my hog's flesh." So the price was set, a groat
    a-pound for the hog's flesh, and sixpence for the woman's. The scales were
    set up, and the planter had a maid that was extremely fat, lazy, and good
    for nothing; her name was Honour. The man brought a great fat sow, and
    put it in one scale, and Honour was put in the other. But when he saw how
    much the maid outweighed his sow, he broke off the bargain and would not
    go on.

<h3>
    SMOKING.
</h3>
<p>
    Such is the passion for smoking at Hamburgh, that children about ten
    years of age may be seen with pipes in their mouths, whiffing with great
    gravity and composure.
</p>

<h3>
    PUBLIC ROADS.
</h3>
<p>
    The turnpike-roads of England are above twenty thousand miles in length,
    and upwards of a million sterling is annually expended in their repair
    and maintenance.

    John Bulwer, M.D. was author of many books, the most curious of which
    were his "Anthropo Metamorphoses,"
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page224" name="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span>
 and "Pathomyotomia." We might conclude
    he was of Irish extraction; St. Patrick, the old song says, "ne'er shut
    his eyes to complaints," and Bulwer in his "Instructions to the Deaf and
    Dumb," tells us they are intended "to bring those who are so born to
    <i>hear</i> the sound of words with their <i>eyes!</i>"&mdash;<i>Wadd's Memoirs</i>.

<h3>
    CRANIOLOGY.
</h3>
<p>
    Philosophy is a very pleasant thing, and has various uses; one is, that
    it makes us laugh; and certainly there are no speculations in philosophy,
    that excite the risible faculties, more than some of the serious stories
    related by fanciful philosophers.&mdash;One man cannot think with the left
    side of his head; another, with the sanity of the right side judges the
    insanity of the left side of his head. Zimmerman, a very grave man, used
    to draw conclusions as to a man's temperament, from his <i>nose!</i>&mdash;not from
    the size or form of it, but the peculiar sensibility of the organ; while
    some have thought, that the temperature of the atmosphere might be
    accurately ascertained by the state of its tip! and Cardan considered
    <i>acuteness of the organ</i> a sure proof of genius!&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.

<h3>
    WILSON THE PAINTER.
</h3>
<p>
    The late Mr. Christie, the auctioneer, while selling a collection of
    pictures, having arrived at a <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i> of Wilson's, was
    expatiating with his usual eloquence on its merits, quite unaware that
    Wilson himself had just before entered the room. "This gentlemen, is one
    of Mr. Wilson's Italian pictures; he cannot paint anything like it now."
    "That's a lie!" exclaimed the irritated artist, to Mr. Christie's no small
    discomposure, and to the great amusement of the company; "he can paint
    infinitely better."
</p>

<h3>
    SCOTCH DEGREE.
</h3>
<p>
    A few years since, a vain old country surgeon obtained a diploma to
    practice, and called on Dr. H&mdash;&mdash;, of Bath, with the important
    intelligence. At dinner, the doctor asked his new brother, if the form of
    diplomas ran now in the same style as at the early commencement of those
    honours? "Pray Sir, what might that form be?" says the surgeon, "I'll
    give it to you," replied our Galen, when stepping to his daughter's
    harpsichord, he sung the following prophecy of the Witches to <i>Macbeth</i>:
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  He must, he must,</p>
<p>  He shall, he shall</p>
<p>  Spill much more blood</p>
<p>  And become worse,</p>
<p>  To make his title good.</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    "That, sir, was the true ancient mode of conferring a Scotch degree on Dr.
    Macbeth."

    THREE FACES.
</h3>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>    Three faces wears the doctor; when first sought</p>
<p>    An angel's&mdash;and a god's the cure half wrought;</p>
<p>    But when, that cure complete, he seeks his fee,</p>
<p>    The devil looks then less terrible than he.</p>
</div></div>
<p>
    This epigram is illustrated by the following conversation, which passed
    between Bouvart and a French marquis, whom he had attended during a long
    and severe indisposition. As he entered the chamber on a certain occasion,
    he was thus addressed by his patient: "Good day to you, Mr. Bouvart; I
    feel quite in spirits, and think my fever has left me."&mdash;"I am sure of it,
    " replied the doctor; "the very first expression you used convinces me of
    it."&mdash;"Pray explain yourself."&mdash;"Nothing more easy; in the first days of
    your illness, when your life was in danger, I was your <i>dearest friend</i>;
    as you began to get better, I was your <i>good Bouvart</i>; and now I am Mr.
    Bouvart; depend upon it you are quite recovered."

<h3>
    LYING.
</h3>
<p>
    A Dutch ambassador, entertaining the king of Siam with an account of
    Holland, after which his majesty was very inquisitive, amongst other
    things told him, that water in his country would sometimes get so hard,
    that men walked upon it; and that it would bear an elephant with the
    utmost ease. To which the king replied, "Hitherto I have believed the
    strange things you have told me, because I looked upon you as a sober,
    fair man; but now <i>I am sure you lie</i>."

<p> Having, not long since, purchased a bottle of Persian Otto,
warranted <i>genuine</i>, (as is all) I laid it carefully by, wrapped
thickly round with cotton wool; the Atar which was certainly excellent,
was in a curious bottle of rough misshapen workmanship, but ornamented
with sundry circles, and lozenges, of various coloured glass. I was
inclined to regard this bottle as a more genuine specimen of oriental
art, than one of those, which, enamelled, with gold, stands forth in its
way an <i>elegant</i> of the first water, and I hoped to have kept it
long. On visiting my Otto shortly afterwards, I found that not only had
it all evaporated, but destroyed its receptacle. Its strength (I
conclude) had dissolved the cement of the aforesaid coloured bits of
glass, and left me only an empty and plain bottle, the ugliest of the
ugly. I mention this circumstance as a caution to amateurs in Atar
Gul.</p>

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
